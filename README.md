## JS-project

### Background and Overview

I'd like to make a music/rhythm game, similar to Guitar Hero or Dance Dance Revolution. I feel pretty stuck on how to move forward though so I'm not sure this is a good idea.

### Functionality & MVP  

In my game, users will be able to:

- [ ] Select a song to play
- [ ] Start, pause, and restart song

### Wireframes

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and game logic,
- `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation and rendering,
- `Web Audio API` for sound generation, processing and control. `WebAudioAPI` allows for simultaneous sounds with more dependable time triggering
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

### Implementation Timeline

**Over the weekend**:
- [ ] Research ideas and web technologies

**Day 1**: Setup all necessary Node modules, including getting webpack up and running. Create `webpack.config.js` as well as `package.json`. Learn the basics of `Web Audio API`.  Goals for the day:

- [ ] Get `webpack` serving files and frame out index.html
- [ ] Learn enough `Web Audio` to render an object to the `Canvas` element and create a sound
